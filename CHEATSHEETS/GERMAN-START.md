### English → German Pronunciation Cheatsheet (for Native English Speakers)

Focus: Avoid the 8 most common fossilized errors that make you sound forever foreign.

- **Vowels – Never pronounce like English!**
  - A = always “ah” as in father (Haus = Hah-oos, NEVER “howse”)
  - E = “ay” when long (See = zay), “eh” when short (Bett = bet)
  - I = “ee” when long (Liebe = lee-buh), “ih” when short (ist = ihst)
  - O = “oh” closed (Boot = boht), never English “oo” or “oh” diphthong
  - U = “oo” but lips ultra-rounded & forward (Buch = boohkh, NOT “buck”)
  - Ä = always “eh” (Mädchen = MED-chen, NEVER “mayd-chen”)
  - Ö = lips rounded “eh” → think “uh” + rounded (schön = shurn)
  - Ü = lips rounded “ee” → think “ee” while whistling (müde = MÜ-deh)

- **Umlaut Rule of Thumb**
  - Start with normal vowel sound → keep tongue position → round lips hard.
  - Practice triad daily: See – Söhne – Süße (ay → öh → üü)

- **Diphthongs – Kill English habits**
  - Ei/ai = “eye” (ein = eyen, NOT “ayne”)
  - Eu/äu = “oy” (heute = hoy-tuh)
  - Au = “ow” as in house (Haus = hows)
  - Ie = long “ee” (nie = nee, NOT “nye”)

- **Consonant Traps (Top 5 Mistakes)**
  - R = uvular/gargled or light tongue-tap, NEVER American retroflex “r”
  - Final consonants = HARD & voiceless: und = oont (NOT “und”), Tag = tahk (NOT “tag”)
  - Ch = two sounds:
    - After a,o,u,au → Scottish “loch” (Buch = boohkh)
    - After e,i,ä,ö,ü,eu → cat hiss (ich = ish)
  - S before p/t at start = “sh” (Stein = shtine, Spatz = shpats)
  - V = “f” (Vogel = FOH-guhl), W = “v” (Wasser = VAH-ser)

- **Stress & Rhythm Rules**
  - Stress almost always on first syllable or root (AU-to, be-GINN-en)
  - Compound words: stress the first part hard (HAUPT-bahn-hof)

- **Daily 5-Minute Fix Drill**
